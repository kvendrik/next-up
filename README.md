**Huge Disclaimer! ⚠️** All credit for the idea behind this app goes to [Ellen Li](https://ellen.li). In almost all ways this is a direct copy of her [Up Next app](https://ellen.li/up-next/). I created this copy because I'm a long time user of her app and wanted to make some tweaks for my specific use-case. Making the tweaks also allowed me to advance my knowledge of Swift.

## How is this different from [Up Next](https://ellen.li/up-next/)?
- Added multi-calendar support
- Remembers selected calendars between startups
- Changed when the button text changes to the next event to 1/3 of the event's duration (e.g. if your current event takes 1 hour then the app will show the next event in the button after 20 minutes)
- Left out the "Present via Google Meet" option

## Roadmap
- [ ] Add open at startup option
- [ ] Clean up code
- [ ] Optimize memory consumption
- [ ] Add v1 release
